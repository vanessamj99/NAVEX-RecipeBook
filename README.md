RecipeBook


In order to have the best experience we suggest you run our program in the **Eclipse IDE**

To do this:
  1. Download Eclipse
  2. Clone the repository (from the **master** branch)
  3. Open Eclipse and import the project files from the directory you have cloned it in
  4. Run RecipeBook Java Application
  5. Voila! You can create, search, and browse recipes. 
  
  (If you got an error about the org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils, just right click the .jar file and add path to it. But normally you should be able to directly run the code!)
